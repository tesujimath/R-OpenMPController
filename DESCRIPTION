Title: Control Number of OpenMP Threads Dynamically
Description: The OpenMPController package provides a function omp_set_num_threads()
        to set the number of OpenMP threads to be used.
        This may be useful, for example, when linking against a vendor
        optimised BLAS/LAPACK library (e.g. the AMD Core Math
        Library), since the defaults used by those libraries may not
        be highly performant.
